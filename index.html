							<p>Hi! I'm Rohan, and my goal is to pursue a career in both science and engineering, a field that interests both my passions simultaneously. To achieve this, I am taking many science and engineering courses at Dublin High. I happen to enjoy these
								two subjects the most as they're both extremely interesting and actually apply to the real world today, and might help me in the future.
							</p>
							<p>As an individual, my personality is one of the highlights of my character. I am very hard-working and persistent. I am friendly and cooperative, while also being intelligent and providing useful information to my peers. From high school, I have
								learned that if I set my mind to something and give it all, I can achieve almost anything with a lot of determination. When my grades start dropping, I need to work hard to bring them back up, but most of the time I succeed and bring them up accordingly.
								An activity that I'm in that demonstrates my skills, is robotics. I'm on the Dubln High robotics team and I work efficently with my team to produce an end result that we have in our mind. I've also joined many clubs in where I participate in community
								service voluntarily, and it shows that I am determined and caring and like to help others. I am also the President of the Cyber-Ed club at Dublin High School. This is a club that helps adults and seniors who struggle with technology, and teaches
								them how to deal with with their day to day to issues. It shows that I am capable of leading and handling a large amount of work alone, or even with others.<br> All in all, the main point I'm trying to get across is that I can work efficently
								with others, and can handle a large load of work alone, and still get through it with some grit and determination. Thank you for visiting my site, and thanks for your time reading my portfolio.</p>
