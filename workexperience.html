					<p>Throughout the years I have had many experience with various professionals and workers from different industries that have provided me with significant insight. <br> In fact, in a guest speaker presentation, Laura Kegelmeyer, a physicist and software engineer at the Lawrence Livermore Lab
					talked about her experiences working with the largest laser in the world. The National Ignition Facility, or NIF for short is a giant laser about two football fields in length located in the Lawrence Livermore Labaratory. Just hearing about her dicuss the internal physics behind the machine
					and what it was physically capable of achieving completely fascinated me. Hearing all about how simple light beams were able to reach temperatures hotter than the Sun made me realize that engineering is capable of some incredible feats, and I knew I wanted to be there in this field to witness
					great achievements such as this. This presentation sparked my intial interest in physics and is one of the main reasons I hope to enter mechanical engineering. <br> Later on in the year I actually took the oppurtinity to visit the Lawrence Livermore Labaratory. I went there for an IT Job shadow,
					and here I learned a lot about various technology topics and quite a bit about cybersecurity as well. I was fascinated to see the teams of people there all so dedicated to work together on projects that had such big impact in society. The lab is run by the government, and so the types of projects
					they work on are of much more importance. Seeing everyone there collectively advancing America's technological achievements was truly awe-inspiring. Seeing the National Ignition Facility in person, however, was the most memorable experience I had that day. I was purely dumbfounded by the scale of 
					the entire facility. Seeing all the mechanical parts in person just showed me what kind of intricate objects mechanical engineers were able to build, and this also inspired me to enter the mechanical side of the engineering field. <br> In terms of actual work experience, I have volunteered at Open
					Heart Kitchen, helping and serving senior citizens by providing them with free meals. It was here where I gained my experience to communicate effectively with people, as understanding and fulfilling requests solely depends on a level of clear communication. Currently, I volunteer at libraries all
					over the Bay Area and host presentations and workshops about cybersecurity because I truly believe everyone needs to learn about how to stay safe on the internet. Here I have learned how to work with a team efficiently and effectively as coordinating these presentations would not be possible if I was alone.</p>
